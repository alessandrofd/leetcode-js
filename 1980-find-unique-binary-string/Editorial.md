### Approach 1: Recursively Generate All Strings

#### Intuition

In the constraints, we see that `n â‰¤ 16`. Given that there are only 2^16^ = 65,536 possible binary strings, it is feasible to generate all of them in an attempt to find one that does not appear in `nums`.

We will use a recursive function `generate(curr)` to generate the binary strings. At each function call, `curr` is the current string we have. First, we check if `curr.length = n`. If it is, we need to stop adding characters and assess if we have an answer. If `curr` is in `nums`, we return an empty string. If it isn't, we return `curr`.

If `curr.length != n`, we will add a character. Since we are generating all strings, we will call both `generate(curr + "0")` and `generate(curr + "1")`. Note that in our base case, we return an empty string if we did not generate a valid answer. Thus, if either call returns a non-empty string, the value it returns is a valid answer.

As each call to generate creates two more calls, the algorithm will have a time complexity of at least $O(2^n)$. However, we can implement a crucial optimization. We will first call `generate(curr + "0")` and store the value in `addZero`. If `addZero` is not an empty string, we can immediately return it as the answer without needing to make the additional call to `generate(curr + "1")`. If `addZero` is an empty string, it means all possible paths from adding a `"0"` lead to invalid answers, and thus `generate(curr + "1")` must generate a valid answer, since it's guaranteed that a valid answer exists.

Why is this optimization such a big deal? Notice that the length of `nums` is `n`. Thus, if we check `n + 1` different strings of length `n`, we will surely find a valid answer. By returning `addZero` early, we terminate the recursion as soon as we find a valid answer, thus we won't check more than `n + 1` strings of length `n`. Without any early returns, we would check $2^n$ strings of length `n`.

Additionally, we will convert `nums` to a hash set prior to starting the recursion, so we can have checks in $O(1)$ time complexity in the base case.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a function `generate(curr)`:

    - If `curr.length = n`:
        - If `curr` is not in `numsSet`, return `curr`.
        - Return an empty string.
    - Set `addZero = generate(curr + "0")`.
    - If `addZero` is not an empty string, return it.
    - Return `generate(curr + "1")`.

2. Set `n = nums.length`.

3. Convert `nums` to a hash set `numsSet`.

4. Return `generate("")`.

#### Complexity Analysis

Given `n` as the length of `nums` (and the length of each binary string),

-   Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

    -   We require $O(n^2)$ to convert `nums` to a hash set.

    -   Due to the optimization, we check $O(n)$ binary strings in our recursion. At each call, we perform some string concatenation operations, which costs up to $O(n)$ (unless you have mutable strings like in C++).

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    -   The recursion call stack when generating strings grows to a size of $O(n)$. The hash set uses $O(n)$ space.

### Approach 2: Iterate Over Integer Equivalents

#### Intuition

Without the optimization, the previous approach would be reasonable when the length of `nums` is not bounded. However, `nums` has a length of `n`. There are many more possible binary strings than there are strings in `nums`.

In fact, since there are only `n` strings in `nums`, we never need to check more than `n + 1` different binary strings, since at least one of them would not appear in `nums` and thus be a valid answer. How do we decide which `n + 1` binary strings we should check?

Let's start by converting each string in `nums` to its equivalent base-10 integer. We will store these integers in a hash set `integers`. Now, we can simply use a for loop to iterate over the range `[0, n]` (the size of this range is `n + 1`, so it is guaranteed to contain at least one valid answer). For each number, we check if it is in `integers`. If it isn't, it represents a valid answer. We just need to convert it back to a binary string of length `n` and return it.

Note that in some cases, if a valid answer, when converted to a binary string, has a length shorter than `n`, we need to add "0"s to the beginning to make its length equal to `n`.

#### Algorithm

1. Create `integers`, a hash set containing all the elements of `nums` in their base-10 integer form.

2. Initialize `n = nums.length`.

3. Iterate `num` from 0 to n:

    - If `num` is not in `integers`, convert it to a binary string of length `n` and return it.

4. The code should never reach this point. Return anything.

#### Complexity Analysis

Given `n` as the length of `nums` (and the length of each binary string),

-   Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

    -   We iterate over `n` strings and convert them to integers, costing $O(n)$ for each integer.

    -   We then iterate `num` in the range `[0, n]`. When we find the answer, we spend $O(n)$ to convert it to a string.

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    -   The hash set `integers` has a size of `n`.

### Approach 3: Random

#### Intuition

As mentioned before, there are many more possible binary strings than there are "banned" binary strings in `nums`.

We can randomly generate binary strings until we find one that is not in `nums`. For `n = 16`, there are $2^{16} = 65536$ strings we could generate, and only $16$ that would not be valid. Thus, the probability of finding a valid answer is $\dfrac{65536 - 16}{65536}$, over 99.9%.

In general, the probability of generating a valid answer randomly is $\dfrac{2^n - n}{2^n}$. Because $2^n$ grows much faster than `n`, the probability is very favorable for us.

For ease of implementation, we will start by converting each binary string in `num` to its base-10 equivalent, then storing these integers in a hash set `integers`, just like in approach 2.

Then, we will generate random numbers in the range $[0, 2^n]$ until we find one not in integers. Once we do, we convert it to a binary string of length `n` and return it.

#### Algorithm

1. Create `integers`, a hash set containing all the elements of `nums` in their base-10 integer form.

2. Set `ans` to any value in `integers` and `n = nums.length`.

3. While `ans` is in `integers`:

    - Randomly generate an integer between `0` (inclusive) and <code>2<sup>n</sup></code>.

4. Set `ans` to the randomly generated integer.

5. Convert `ans` to a binary string and return it.

### Complexity Analysis

Given `n` as the length of `nums` (and the length of each binary string),

-   Time complexity: $O(\infty)$

    -   Technically, the worst-case scenario would see the algorithm running infinitely, always selecting elements in `integers`. However, the probability that the algorithm runs for more than a few steps, let alone infinitely, is so low that we can assume it to be effectively 0. This probability also lowers exponentially as `n` increases.

    -   For `n = 16`, there is an over 99.9% chance that we find an answer on the first iteration. For `n = 20`, we have an over 99.998% chance. Practically, this algorithm runs extremely quickly.

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    -   The hash set `integers` has a size of `n`.

    -   We don't count the answer as part of the space complexity.

### Approach 4: Cantor's Diagonal Argument

#### Intuition

[Cantor's diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) is a proof in set theory.

While we do not need to fully understand the proof and its consequences, this approach uses very similar ideas.

We start by initializing the answer `ans` to an empty string. To build `ans`, we need to assign either "0" or "1" to each index `i` for indices `0` to `n - 1`. How do we assign them so `ans` is guaranteed to be different from every string in `nums`? We know that two strings are different, as long as they differ by at least one character. We can intentionally construct our `ans` based on this fact.

For each index `i`, we will check the i^th^ character of the i^th^ string in `ans`. That is, we check `curr = nums[i][i]`. We then assign `ans[i]` to the opposite of `curr`. That is, if `curr = "0"`, we assign `ans[i] = "1"`. If `curr = "1"`, we assign `ans[i] = "0"`.

What is the point of this strategy? `ans` will differ from every string in at least one position. More specifically:

-   `ans` differs from `nums[0]` in `nums[0][0]`.
-   `ans` differs from `nums[1]` in `nums[1][1]`.
-   `ans` differs from `nums[2]` in `nums[2][2]`.
-   ...
-   `ans` differs from `nums[n - 1]` in `nums[n - 1][n - 1]`.

Thus, it is guaranteed that `ans` does not appear in `nums` and is a valid answer.

This strategy is applicable because both the length of `ans` and the length of each string in `nums` are larger than or equal to `n`, the number of strings in `nums`. Therefore, we can find one unique position for each string in `nums`.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize the answer `ans`. Note that you should build the answer in an efficient manner according to the programming language you're using.

2. Iterate `i` over the indices of `nums`:

    - Set `curr = nums[i][i]`.

    - If `curr = "0"`, add `"1"` to `ans`. Otherwise, add `"0"` to `ans`.

3. Return `ans`.

### Complexity Analysis

Given `n` as the length of `nums` (and the length of each binary string),

-   Time complexity: $O(n)$

    -   We iterate over each string in `nums`. Assuming the string building is efficient, each iteration costs $O(1)$, and joining the answer string at the end costs $O(n)$.

-   Space complexity: $O(1)$

    -   We don't count the answer as part of the space complexity.
