   * Intuitively, we want to put the paid painter on walls that cost less and
   * take longer to paint. The longer the paid painter paints, the more we can
   * make use of the free painter. It seems extremely difficult to formulate a
   * greedy approach since decisions will cascade on top of each other. Which
   *  walls do we pay for? Which walls do we have the free painter paint?
   *
   * Given the constraints n â‰¤ 500, we should try a dynamic programming
   * approach, which will consider all possible decisions.
   *
   * Let's say that we spend money and the paid painter paints for t time.
   * The paid painter will paint 1 wall, and the free painter will paint
   * t walls. Thus, we spend money to paint 1 + t walls.
   *
   * This is a variation of the classic knapsack problem. The ith item costs
   * cost[i] and paints 1 + time[i] walls. We need to paint n walls while
   * minimizing the total cost.
   *
   * Let dp(i, remain) be a function that returns the minimum cost to paint
   * remain walls when considering index i and beyond. We have two base cases
   * here.
   *
   *    If remain <= 0, we have painted all the walls. We can return 0.
   *
   *    If i == n, we have run out of walls to put the paid painter on and the
   *    task is impossible. We return a large value like infinity.
   *
   * Now, how do we calculate a given state (i, remain)? For the ith wall, we
   * have two options. We can either hire the paid painter for this wall or not
   * hire them.
   *
   *    If we hire them, as mentioned above, we spend cost[i] and paint
   *    1 + time[i] walls. Then, we move to the next index. Thus, the cost of
   *    this option is cost[i] + dp(i + 1, remain - 1 - time[i]).
   *
   *    If we don't hire them, we simply move to the next index. The cost of
   *    this option is dp(i + 1, remain).
   *
   * Let's call the first option paint and the second option dontPaint. Then,
   * dp(i, remain) = min(paint, dontPaint).
   *
   * This recursive approach is correct, but has an exponential time complexity
   * because each dp call creates two more dp calls, some of which may have
   * already been calculated. We must memoize our function to avoid repeated
   * computation.
   *
   *  The solution to the original problem will be dp(0, n). We consider all
   * walls starting from index 0 and beyond, and we need to paint a total of
   * n walls.
