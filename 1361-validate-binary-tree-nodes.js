/**
 * You have n binary tree nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 where node i has two
 * children leftChild[i] and rightChild[i], return true if and only if all the
 * given nodes form exactly one valid binary tree.
 *
 * If node i has no left child then leftChild[i] will equal -1, similarly for
 * the right child.
 *
 * Note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in
 * this problem.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *    n == leftChild.length == rightChild.length
 *    1 <= n <= 10^4
 *    -1 <= leftChild[i], rightChild[i] <= n - 1
 *
 * Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Graph,
 * Binary Tree
 *
 * Hints:
 *    Find the parent of each node.
 *
 *    A valid tree must have nodes with only one parent and exactly one node
 *    with no parent.
 *
 * Overview:
 *
 * Before we go into the approaches, let's first talk about what makes a binary
 * tree valid.
 *
 *    Obs: Note that while this is not a formal definition of a binary tree,
 *    these rules are sufficient for solving the problem.
 *
 *    1.  A binary tree must have a root. This is a node with no incoming edges-
 *        that is, the root has no parent.
 *
 *    2.  Every node other than the root must have exactly one parent.
 *
 *    3. The tree must be connected - every node must be reachable from one node
 *        (the root).
 *
 *    4.  There cannot be a cycle.
 *
 * To solve this problem, we can check the nodes given to us against these rules.
 *
 *    You may notice that some of these rules imply each other. For example, if
 *    a binary tree had a root, it would have a cycle only if there was a node
 *    with more than one parent.

  /**
   * Approach 1: Depth First Search (DFS)
   *
   * One way to solve this problem would be to perform a DFS on the tree and
   * check that all the rules are followed. Before we can start a DFS, we need
   * to locate the root. Let's define a function findRoot that helps us find the
   * root.
   *
   * As mentioned above, the root has no parent - this also means that the root
   * is not the child of any nodes. The input arrays leftChild and rightChild
   * describe all children, so the root would not appear in these arrays. We can
   * simply use a for loop from 0 to n - 1 and for each number, check if it is
   * present in leftChild or rightChild. If it's not present in either, then we
   * can return it as the root. If we don't find any root, we can return -1.
   *
   * To improve efficiency, we will convert leftChild and rightChild to a set
   * for O(1) checks.
   *
   * We will start by obtaining root = findRoot(). If root = -1, there is no
   * node without a parent, and we can immediately return false as the tree is
   * invalid.
   *
   * Once we have the root, we can start a DFS from it. We will implement the
   * DFS iteratively with a stack. How can we validate the tree? First of all,
   * if we see a node multiple times during the DFS, it means a node has
   * multiple parents (and there could be a cycle). We will use a set seen that
   * keeps track of all the nodes we have seen so far during the traversal. When
   * we move to a child, if child is already in seen, we can immediately return
   * false since we would be visiting child for the second time.
   *
   * Once the DFS finishes, every node we visited will be in seen. If the tree
   * is connected, then the length of seen will be equal to n. If
   * seen.length != n, it means that some nodes were not visited, and thus the
   * tree must be disconnected. Thus, we can return seen.length == n at the end
   * of the algorithm.
   *
   * This process is sufficient in validating a binary tree:
   *
   *    1.  If a binary tree does not have a root, then findRoot will return -1.
   *
   *    2.  If there is a node with more than one parent, then we will detect it
   *        with seen.
   *
   *    3.  If the tree is disconnected, then seen will hold less than n nodes
   *        at the end.
   *
   *    4.  If there is a cycle, then we will detect it with seen.
   *
   * Any other scenario we don't explicitly check for will be caught by some
   * other rule. For example, the second rule we stated was:
   *
   *    Every node other than the root must have exactly one parent.
   *
   * You may be thinking: we are explicitly checking the case when a node has
   * multiple parents with seen, but what if there is a node with no parent
   * other than the root? That is, what if there are multiple roots? In that
   * scenario, findRoot would give us the root with the lowest value. We would
   * perform a DFS from there, and never reach any of the other roots. Then at
   * the end, seen would have less than n nodes.

   * Approach 3: Union Find
   * 
   * A disjoint-set data structure (also called a unionâ€“find), is a data 
   * structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. 
   * Union-find provides us with the following methods:
   * 
   *    find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be 
   *    used to determine if two elements are in the same subset.
   * 
   *    union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
   * 
   * Initially, all nodes belong to their own subset. We will iterate over all 
   * (parent, child) pairs given in leftChild and rightChild and attempt a union. 
   * We want to assign the subset of child to the subset of parent. For each 
   * call to union(parent, child), we can see if the tree is invalid with the 
   * following checks:
   * 
   *    If find(child) != child, then child must have been assigned a parent 
   *    earlier, and thus child has multiple parents.
   * 
   *    If parent and child already belong to the same subset, then there must 
   *    be a directed path from child to parent as parent must have been 
   *    assigned to the subset of child earlier, and thus there exists a cycle.
   * 
   * After performing all union operations successfully between parents and 
   * their children, there should only be one component in the union-find data 
   * structure. We can track the number of components by subtracting one from 
   * the count on each successful union operation, and then check whether the 
   * final count of components is equal to 1.
