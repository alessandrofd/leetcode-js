/**
 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except
 * for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a
 * locked room without having its key.
 *
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key
 * has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of
 * them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 *
 * Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if
 * you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *    n == rooms.length
 *    2 <= n <= 1000
 *    0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
 *    1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
 *    0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
 *    All the values of rooms[i] are unique.
