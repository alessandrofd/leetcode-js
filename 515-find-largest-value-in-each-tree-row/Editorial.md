Approach 1: Breadth First Search (BFS)
Intuition

If you are not familiar with BFS traversal, we suggest you read our relevant LeetCode Explore Card.

BFS is perfect when we are dealing specifically with rows/levels of a binary tree. With BFS, we handle one row of the tree at a time.

Here, we need to find the maximum value in each row. We can simply perform a BFS and for each row, keep track of the maximum value we have seen so far. We will initialize an integer currMax to a small value like negative infinity. Then we go through the row and try to update currMax when we see larger values. After handling the row, we add currMax to our answer.

Algorithm

If the root is null (empty) tree, just return an empty list.
Initialize the answer list ans and a queue with the root to perform BFS.
Perform BFS - while the queue is not empty:
Initialize currMax to a small value and save the length of the queue in currentLength.
Iterate currentLength times:
Remove a node from the queue.
Update currMax with node.val if it is larger.
For each child of node, if it is not null, push it to the queue.
Add currMax to ans.
Return ans.

Complexity Analysis

Given nnn as the number of nodes in the tree,

Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)

During the BFS, we visit each node in the tree once. At each node, we perform O(1)O(1)O(1) work.

Space complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)

In a perfect binary tree, the final row has O(n2)=O(n)O(\frac{n}{2}) = O(n)O( 
2
n
â€‹
 )=O(n) nodes, all of which will be in queue.

Approach 2: Depth First Search (DFS)
Intuition

Note: This problem is perfect for BFS, but an interviewer might you to implement DFS as a follow-up. We have included a DFS approach for completeness.

In BFS, we handle each row explicitly, so it's easy to just keep track of the maximum value as we traverse through the row.

In DFS, the order in which we move through the tree is not related to the rows. Thus, we need to be more creative to find the maximum value in each row. The first observation to make is that each row can be described by the depth of its nodes.

depth


The depth of a node is its distance from the root. The root has a depth of 0, and every child has a depth of 1 greater than its parent. You may also notice that in terms of indices, each node's depth corresponds to its index in the answer.

For example, if ans is our answer list, then ans[2] holds the maximum value of all nodes with depth 2.

If we keep track of each node's depth during the traversal, then we can update ans directly. How do we keep track of the depth? We will pass an additional argument depth in our dfs function. When we initially call dfs with root, we will pass depth = 0. When we call dfs on a child, we will pass depth + 1.

There is one problem: how do we know what length ans should be? We will initialize ans as an empty list. If we are at a depth that would be out of bounds if we tried to access ans[depth], then we will simply initialize the current node.val as the maximum value seen at depth so far by pushing node.val to ans.

Algorithm

Initialize ans as an empty list.
Define a function dfs(node, depth):
If node is null, return.
If depth == ans.length, then push node.val to ans. Otherwise, try to update ans[depth] with node.val if its larger.
Call dfs on node.left and node.right with depth + 1 as the second argument.
Call dfs(root, 0) and then return ans.

Complexity Analysis

Given nnn as the number of nodes in the tree and hhh as the max depth of the tree,

Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)

During the DFS, we visit each node in the tree once. At each node, we perform O(1)O(1)O(1) work.

Space complexity: O(h)O(h)O(h)

We use extra space for the recursion call stack. The most calls in the call stack at any given time will be the max depth of the tree. In the worst-case scenario where the tree is like a linked list, the max depth will be O(n)O(n)O(n).



Approach 3: DFS, Iterative
Intuition

We can also implement DFS iteratively using a stack. Each entry in the stack will be a pair node, depth. We will use a while loop to perform the DFS, with each iteration being analogous to a function call from the previous approach. As such, we will perform the same process in each while loop iteration: try to update ans with node.val, then push the children of node to the stack if they exist.

Algorithm

If the root is null (empty) tree, just return an empty list.
Initialize the answer list ans and a stack with (root, 0).
While the stack is not empty:
Pop (node, depth) from the stack.
If depth == ans.length, then push node.val to ans. Otherwise, try to update ans[depth] with node.val if its larger.
If node.left is not null, push (node.left, depth + 1) to stack.
If node.right is not null, push (node.right, depth + 1) to stack.
Return ans.

Complexity Analysis

Given nnn as the number of nodes in the tree and hhh as the max depth of the tree,

Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)

During the DFS, we visit each node in the tree once. At each node, we perform O(1)O(1)O(1) work.

Space complexity: O(h)O(h)O(h)

We use extra space for the recursion call stack. The most calls in the call stack at any given time will be the max depth of the tree. In the worst-case scenario where the tree is like a linked list, the max depth will be O(n)O(n)O(n).

We pop the top node from the stack and then push its child nodes onto the stack based on the DFS traversal strategy. This process of pushing and popping forms a path-like structure within the stack, and the length of this path will not exceed the height of the tree. Therefore, O(h)O(h)O(h) space will be used.
